    <section id="faq">
        <p>
            Frequently asked questions, abbreviated to FAQ, are listed questions and answers, all supposed to be
            commonly asked in some context, and pertaining to a particular topic. The format is commonly used on
            email mailing lists and other online forums, where certain common questions tend to recur.

            "FAQ" is pronounced as either an initialism (F-A-Q) or an acronym. Since the acronym FAQ originated in
            textual media, its pronunciation varies; "fack", "faak", "fax", and "facts" are commonly heard.
            Depending on usage, the term may refer specifically to a single frequently asked question, or to an
            assembled list of many questions and their answers. Some web page designers may label the list of
            questions as "FAQ," such as on <a href="https://google.com">Google.com</a> , other websites use "FAQs,"
            such as on United States Treasury sites.
